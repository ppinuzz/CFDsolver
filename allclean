# More in detail (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6393551/):
# $0	0-th argument (i.e. the path that called the script)
# %	is a pattern matching operator: VAR%PATTERN removes from VAR the SHORTEST occurrent of PATTERN
#	therefore %/* matches the LAST occurrence of '/' and removes anything ('*') after it
#	(i.e. it removes the name of the script from the path that called this script)
# Written in a WRONG but readable way (i.e. it doesn't work, but it's easier to understand), this would be
# $0 % /*
# Since this requires parameter expansion, the {} are needed: ${0%/*}
# As always, use the "..." to stay safe and avoid unwanted expansions
